  "title": "Answer Generation",
  "description": "Answer generation is where the LLM produces a response based on the user's query and the retrieved context, synthesizing information into a coherent answer.",
  "whatItDoes": "The LLM takes the assembled context and user query to generate a natural language response. It synthesizes relevant information from the context, formats the answer appropriately, and delivers the final output to the user.",
  "whyItMatters": "This is the culmination of the RAG pipeline where value is delivered to the user. A well-performed answer generation produces responses that are correct (grounded in facts), complete, and clear, significantly reducing hallucinations compared to using the LLM alone.",
  "challenges": [
    "Preventing hallucinations even with provided context",
    "Ensuring the model uses the context rather than prior knowledge",
    "Balancing verbosity and relevance in responses",
    "Handling cases where the retrieved context doesn't contain the answer",
    "Preventing information leakage from sensitive context"
