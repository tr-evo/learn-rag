  "description": "Embedding creation transforms text chunks into numerical vector representations that capture semantic meaning.",
  "whatItDoes": "Embedding models convert text into high-dimensional vectors where similar texts are positioned closer together in the vector space. These embeddings enable semantic search and similarity matching.",
  "whyItMatters": "The quality of your embeddings directly affects retrieval accuracy. Better embeddings capture more nuanced semantic relationships and lead to more relevant search results.",
  "challenges": [
    "Selecting appropriate embedding models for your domain",
    "Handling multilingual content effectively",
    "Managing embedding dimensionality and computational costs",
    "Dealing with embedding model limitations and biases",
    "Keeping embeddings up-to-date with model advancements"
