  "description": "DE Embedding creation transforms text chunks into numerical vector representations that capture semantic meaning.",
  "whatItDoes": "DE Embedding models convert text into high-dimensional vectors where similar texts are positioned closer together in the vector space. These embeddings enable semantic search and similarity matching.",
  "whyItMatters": "DE The quality of your embeddings directly affects retrieval accuracy. Better embeddings capture more nuanced semantic relationships and lead to more relevant search results.",
  "challenges": [
    "DE Selecting appropriate embedding models for your domain",
