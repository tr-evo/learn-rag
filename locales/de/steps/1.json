  "title": "DE Source Preprocessing",
  "description": "DE The first step in building a RAG system is to preprocess your source documents. This involves cleaning, normalizing, and preparing your text data for further processing.",
  "whatItDoes": "DE Source preprocessing transforms raw documents into clean, normalized text that's ready for chunking and embedding. It handles tasks like removing irrelevant content, standardizing formats, and extracting useful metadata.",
  "whyItMatters": "DE High-quality preprocessing directly impacts the quality of your RAG system. Clean, well-structured text leads to better chunks, more accurate embeddings, and ultimately more relevant responses.",
  "challenges": [
    "DE Handling diverse document formats (PDF, HTML, Word, etc.)",
    "DE Preserving document structure and formatting that provides context",
    "DE Removing boilerplate content while keeping important information",
    "DE Extracting and preserving metadata for later use",
    "DE Dealing with tables, images, and other non-text content",
    "DE Handling OCR artifacts, misrecognition, and layout confusion in scanned documents"
