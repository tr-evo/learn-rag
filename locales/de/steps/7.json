  "description": "DE Query understanding processes and interprets user queries to improve retrieval accuracy and response relevance.",
  "whatItDoes": "DE Query understanding analyzes user queries to identify intent, extract key concepts, expand terms, and transform the query into a form that maximizes retrieval effectiveness. It may involve query classification, expansion, reformulation, or decomposition.",
  "whyItMatters": "DE Better query understanding leads to more relevant retrievals. By interpreting what users are really asking for, rather than just matching keywords, RAG systems can provide more accurate and helpful responses.",
  "challenges": [
    "DE Handling ambiguous or underspecified queries",
    "DE Balancing query expansion with precision",
    "DE Decomposing complex queries into manageable sub-queries",
    "DE Maintaining context across multi-turn conversations",
    "DE Adapting to domain-specific terminology and concepts"
