  "description": "DE Chunking breaks down documents into smaller, manageable pieces that can be individually embedded and retrieved.",
  "whatItDoes": "DE Chunking splits documents into smaller segments based on various strategies like size, semantic boundaries, or structural elements. These chunks become the basic units for embedding and retrieval.",
  "whyItMatters": "DE The way you chunk documents significantly impacts retrieval quality. Good chunking preserves context, reduces noise, and ensures that relevant information is retrieved together.",
  "challenges": [
    "DE Determining optimal chunk size for your specific use case",
    "DE Preserving context across chunk boundaries",
    "DE Handling documents with varying structures",
    "DE Balancing chunk granularity with retrieval precision",
    "DE Managing overlapping chunks to preserve context"
