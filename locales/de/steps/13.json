  "description": "DE Post-processing refines and validates the raw LLM output before presenting it to the end-user, ensuring quality, correctness, and appropriate formatting.",
  "whatItDoes": "DE Takes the raw output from the LLM and applies various transformations such as formatting (bullet points, markdown, JSON), fact-checking against source documents, adding citations, filtering inappropriate content, and summarizing when needed. It serves as a quality control layer before delivering the final response.",
  "whyItMatters": "DE Even with context, LLMs can produce outputs that benefit from an extra check. Post-processing ensures the final answer is not only correct but also presented appropriately. It increases trust and usability by delivering polished, verified responses aligned with application-specific requirements.",
  "challenges": [
    "DE Implementing reliable automated fact-checking against source documents",
    "DE Modifying outputs without changing their meaning or introducing errors",
    "DE Adding accurate citations that correctly link statements to sources",
    "DE Balancing thoroughness with response latency",
    "DE Creating robust systems that can handle unexpected model outputs"
